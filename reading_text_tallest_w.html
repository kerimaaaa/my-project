                    In many ways Rumeysa Gelgi is a normal young woman in her 20s. The 26-year-old web developer from
                    Turkey enjoys sightseeing, swimming and reading mystery stories. She has a cat called Peri, and she
                    loves her family.

                    However, in other ways Rumeysa is very special. At 215.16 centimeters tall, she is the tallest woman
                    alive in the world today.

                    And that isn't Rumeysa's only record. According to Guinness World Records, she also has the largest
                    hands, longest finger and longest back of any living woman.

                    Rumeysa's size is caused by a rare genetic condition called Weaver syndrome.

                    Unfortunately, this condition also causes several health problems, and she often uses a wheelchair
                    to move around.

                    Because of these health problems, Rumeysa had a difficult childhood. She was never able to go to
                    school, but studied at home.

                    And she was bullied because of how she looks.
                    <br>
                    Even now she says she is sometimes still bullied by people making unkind comments on the internet.

                    However, she believes such comments come from ignorance. So she speaks online and on TV to help
                    educate people about her condition, and to encourage people who have similar problems.

                    Rumeysa got her first world record when she became the world's tallest teenager in 2014. Since then,
                    she has used her records to help share her positive message.

                    Speaking to The Guardian in 2023, Rumeysa said she hopes her story will remind people to be kind to
                    others who are different. And to people who are struggling with being different, she says, "Always
                    believe that you're unique, and it's your uniqueness that makes you special."

                    "Our differences are what make us beautiful on the inside as well as out," she said.
