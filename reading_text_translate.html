                    Google Translate is used by hundreds of millions of people every day, and supports more than 130
                    languages.

                    Over the years, it has become more accurate — although if you're looking for perfect translations,
                    you're still in the wrong place. But it can be very useful for getting a basic understanding of a
                    foreign language.

                    But did you know it can also do more? Here are four handy things Translate can do!

                    Save your favorites
                    If you find you're often searching for the same word or phrase on the Translate website, click the
                    star to the right of the translation.

                    This will save the translation for next time — and you'll be able to see your saved words by
                    clicking on the "Saved" button below the translation boxes.

                    Get offline translations
                    If you need translations when traveling abroad but don't have good Wi-Fi, you can download languages
                    to use offline.
                    <br>
                    You'll need the app for this.

                    In the bottom right corner, click on "Settings," and then select "Offline translation" and "Add a
                    language." Choose the languages you want, and you'll then be able to translate to and from them even
                    when you're offline.

                    Translate spoken conversations …
                    The app and the Translate website both allow users to speak into their device and see the words
                    translated. But the app can also translate both parts of a conversation in real time. Just look for
                    the "Conversation" button at the bottom of the screen.

                    So if you're in a shop abroad, you don't even have to show anyone your screen — you can just speak
                    and listen!

                    … And words in photos
                    The app can also translate words from pictures you take on your device's camera. So if you're on
                    holiday and looking at a sign, you can take a photo in the app and have the words translated.
