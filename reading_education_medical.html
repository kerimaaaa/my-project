                    Many of us worry about going to the doctor, and that feeling may be even worse if you're in a
                    different country.

                    So it might help to know a few common English words and phrases that you may hear or use.

                    If you're seeing a doctor — and not going to hospital — most of the time, you'll need to make an
                    appointment first.

                    You might be asked whether your problem is "urgent," meaning you need an appointment as soon as
                    possible.

                    When you do arrive at the doctor's office, you may be asked to "take a seat," which means sit down —
                    and wait!
                    <br>

                    A secretary may ask if you have any medical insurance, and perhaps to "complete some paperwork" —
                    write down some information about yourself.

                    Now it's time to speak to the doctor. Doctors sometimes begin with: "What seems to be the problem?"
                    That's just the same as asking why you're there, or for you to talk about your symptoms.

                    You may be "experiencing" — feeling — pain. Or, if it's not quite so bad, you could call it
                    "discomfort" instead of pain.

                    The doctor may then decide to do an examination. They might also want to "run" — or, do — some
                    tests.

                    You may need a prescription for some medicine, or an appointment with a specialist.

                    You might also need a "follow-up visit" with the doctor, which means you'll be returning to the same
                    office again.
