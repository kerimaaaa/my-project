                    People Are Using AI to Write Wedding Vows

                    Writing a good speech takes lots of practice — and especially for an important event like a wedding,
                    thinking of the perfect speech can be stressful.

                    So why not ask artificial intelligence (AI) to write your speech for you, like a woman in the US
                    did?

                    Elyse Nguyen was struggling to write her wedding vows when a friend recommended she try ChatGPT.

                    ChatGPT is a computer program that you can ask to write things the same way you might ask a person.
                    It uses AI to understand what you say, and gives you answers that are as human as possible.

                    Thinking it was a joke, Nguyen asked ChatGPT to write wedding vows for her.

                    But she was surprised to find she liked parts of what ChatGPT wrote.
                    <br>
                    After changing some of the information to make the speech more personal, she decided to use a lot of
                    what ChatGPT had written for her wedding.

                    Nguyen said using ChatGPT to make her vows was less stressful than writing them herself, and the
                    program was very good at thinking of interesting speech ideas.

                    Nguyen isn't the only person who has tried using technology to help with their wedding — an American
                    company called ToastWiz even makes speeches for weddings using the same AI program.

                    ToastWiz says it will email you your wedding speech in just a few minutes.

                    But Josh Withers, a wedding celebrant from Australia, says vows written by a computer might not be
                    as genuine as vows written by a person.

                    Speaking to The New York Times, Withers said, "You'll lose the humanity, the moments that make us
                    feel love."
