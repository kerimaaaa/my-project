                    With the nearly identical components shared by language and art, it is easy to wonder if they
                    developed naturally parallel to each other. After all, language and art were two of the first
                    developments of early civilizations. Throughout the ages, the two have mutually supported one
                    another, with drawings often expressing what words could not. Additionally, history shows us over
                    and over that the arts play an even greater role in capturing and promoting cultures. The songs,
                    paintings, or poetry of a culture may represent the history of a people, while the colors in a sand
                    sculpture might provide inspiration for the scientist who explores different combinations of
                    molecules. The arts give rise to many voices – they can nurture a sense of belonging, or they can
                    foster a sense of being apart. Through artwork, people can introduce themselves in a deep and
                    meaningful way that might not emerge through verbal communication.
                    <br> <br>
                    Similarly, art can be applied to language learning. When learning a language, arts can be seen as a
                    medium to work with different ideas and concepts. For example, poetry can help a student learning a
                    second language to work towards making sense of his or her surroundings. Poetry provides a structure
                    through which the student can apply their observations while actively working with a knowledge base
                    and constructing understandings of nature through an art form. This way, the person can apply his or
                    her observations in an imaginative manner, all while developing vocabulary, improving comprehension,
                    and thinking in the new language. With art, learning foreign languages goes beyond grammar –
                    students are also able to develop an appreciation for art and language as well as the rich culture
                    and history the language holds.

                <h4>Art and Culture</h4>
                <p>
                    Art has the ability to cross many boundaries, including those that exist in communication. In a
                    children’s classroom, for example, where many different nationalities are combined and different
                    languages spoken, art can break the barriers of communication. For example, a student who has just
                    arrived from Peru may not yet be able to verbally communicate with her English- speaking classmates,
                    but she will be able to adequately express herself through drawings or dances. This way, the
                    interaction not only allows the classmates to communicate, but also introduces them to the “feel” of
                    a different culture.
                    <br>
                    As a language of expression, art gives rise to many voices and opens many paths to work with
                    knowledge. When properly applied, the arts can play a vital role in stimulating creativity all while
                    acting as a catalyst for learning, discovery, and achievement.
