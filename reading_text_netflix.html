                    if you observe the work of art and come to understand the meaning of it, then you might be guided to
                    be both moral and spiritually uplifted. For example, art is the presentation of the artist’s view of
                    reality and his understanding of what goes into deep emotions that had to be thought through to be
                    accepted. Michelangelo’s David is a depiction of a brave and courageous man about to go into battle
                    with supreme confidence. So, by understanding that poise you can come to feel moral courage in the
                    face of your battles and be spiritually motivated to accomplish great tasks. Ayn Rand wrote a whole
                    book on the nature of art called The Romantic Manifesto, which goes into a lot of detail, and I
                    highly recommend reading it for the insights of the author. I also wrote an essay on The Purpose of
                    Art to try to make the same points, and it is available here:

                    “In The Romantic Manifesto, Ayn Rand shows that the purpose of art is to concretize an abstraction –
                    to make an idea real in material form. * This is necessitated by man’s means of cognition, that
                    ideas can be vague and uncertain, unless one has a very clear grasp of the facts organized in the
                    right way (according to objective principles). Even an idea that is close to the perceptually
                    self-evident – like the concept “apple” – can be difficult to keep in mind without a specific memory
                    of a particular apple. What the artist does is to take his concept of the apple and puts it onto
                    canvas by presenting the perceptual concretes that make it possible to identify the object as an
                    apple (i.e. a red skin and a roundish shape, and reflective highlights, etc.). By doing this, he
                    makes the idea real on canvas.

                    The better the artist the better the skill at rendering ideas onto canvas; and one of my favorite
                    paintings is “Pygmalion and Galatea” by Gerome. In this one painting, he captures the story of
                    Pygmalion, who rejected women in favor of his work, until he created a statue of the perfect woman
                    and fell in love with it. According to legend, Aphrodite saw the statue, greatly admired its beauty,
                    and made it into a real woman for Pygmalion to love and to admire. Gerome captures all of this in
                    his painting, making the event real in terms of specific concretes presented on canvas.”
