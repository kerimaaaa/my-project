                <p>
                    Everybody has different opinions about what is good. These opinions are called preferences –
                    basically what you like and even how you like it. Coffee, for instance. Do you take it black? Or do
                    you add milk and sugar to it? Maybe you don’t even like coffee. The thing is: we change our opinions
                    as we grow older and discover new things. Some external factors, such as food allergies or moving to
                    a new city or country, also affect our feelings toward things or actions. The thing is, the way you
                    communicate your opinions doesn’t have to be boring! There are dozens of phrases to talk about your
                    likes and dislikes, which are also called preference synonyms. Read on for more information on
                    expressing preferences in English.

                <h4> Describing our preferences</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the easiest ways to express our likes is with a verb. Don’t feel trapped by using the word
                    like though! There are so many synonyms and phrases that will allow you to be creative with your
                    expressions.
                    Other ways to describe your likes and dislikes is with phrases specific to the situation. For
                    example, when it comes to food, we can say some people are picky eaters. You probably know somebody
                    like that. A picky eater is someone who refuses food often or ends up eating the same food over and
                    over again. Lots of kids are picky eaters, but adults can also be like that.
                    <br><br>
                    Example: Mike hates cucumbers and tomatoes. He is such a picky eater!
                    <br><br>
                    Some people have a sweet tooth, which means they often crave sweet foods, such as cakes, cookies,
                    and chocolate.
                    <br><br>
                    Example: I spend a good amount of money on candies to try to satisfy my sweet tooth.
                    <br><br>
                    Another phrase you may hear is with the word junkie. Please note this word has a very serious
                    connotation about a person who is addicted to drugs. However, it is also used to describe someone
                    who likes something to the extreme, like a sports junkie. While this term can be innocent, I would
                    not recommend using it! It is not suitable to use around children, either.
                    <br><br>
                    Can you think of any other phrases to describe specific activities or situations?

                <h4> Easy phrases to say ‘I like’ something </h4><br><br>
                <p>
                    The easiest way to approve of a noun (person, place or thing) or an action is to use the verbs
