                    One of the best things about traveling is trying new food. But ordering in a different language can
                    be difficult.

                    If you've chosen a great place to eat, make sure you get a table by making a reservation. This might
                    also be called "making a booking" or "reserving a table."

                    You may be asked how many people there are "in your party." In this situation, "party" means
                    "group."

                    When you arrive for your meal, begin by saying, "We have a booking under the name of Sarah" â€” if
                    your name is Sarah!
                    <br>

                    Now for the food. The server may ask to "take your order," or they could say: "What can I get you?"
                    These are different ways of asking what you'd like to eat and drink.

                    If you're not sure what to choose, ask if they can recommend anything. Or if you're not ready, you
                    could ask for "a few more minutes to decide."

                    It can be difficult working out what different dishes contain if they're new to you. If you don't
                    eat meat, for example, be sure to ask: "Is this OK for vegetarians?"

                    When you're ready to pay, what you say may depend on where you are. You will usually ask for the
                    "bill" in the UK or Australia, and the "check" in the US.

                    And if you couldn't finish the food, you could ask to "take the rest to go," meaning you'll carry it
                    out with you.
