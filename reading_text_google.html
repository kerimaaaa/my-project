                    Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering researcher who has been called the "Godfather of AI," has quit his
                    role at Google so he can more freely speak about the dangers of the technology he helped create.

                    Over his long career, Hinton's pioneering work on deep learning and neural networks has helped lay
                    the foundation for much of the AI technology we see today.

                    Some of the dangers of AI chatbots are "quite scary," Hinton told the BBC. "Right now, they're not
                    more intelligent than us, as far as I can tell. But I think they soon may be."

                    In an interview with MIT Technology Review, Hinton also talked about "bad actors" that may use AI in
                    ways that could have harmful impacts on society — such as manipulating elections or encouraging
                    violence.

                    Hinton, 75, says he retired from Google so that he could speak openly about the potential risks as
                    someone who no longer works for the tech giant.
                    <br> <br>
                    "I want to talk about AI safety issues without having to worry about how it interacts with Google's
                    business," he told MIT Technology Review. "As long as I'm paid by Google, I can't do that."

                    Since announcing his departure, Hinton has said that Google has "acted very responsibly" regarding
                    AI. He told MIT Technology Review that there's also "a lot of good things about Google" that he
                    would want to talk about — but those comments would be "much more credible if I'm not at Google
                    anymore."

                    Hinton was one of three AI pioneers who in 2019 won the Turing Award, which has become known as the
                    tech industry's version of the Nobel Prize. The other two winners, Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun,
                    have also expressed concerns about the future of AI.

                    Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal, signed a petition in late March asking for tech
                    companies to agree to a 6-month pause on developing powerful AI systems, while LeCun, a top AI
                    scientist at Facebook's parent company Meta, has taken a more optimistic approach.
