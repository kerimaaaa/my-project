                    What is that!? The word that is a demonstrative pronoun, just like <b> this </b>! And <b> these
                    </b>! And <b> those </b> over
                    there! Demonstrative pronouns are a type of pronoun used to represent something so you don’t have to
                    repeat words. Because of this, they help make your communication more efficient.
                    <br><br>
                    Demonstrative pronouns are very important in every language, including English. You’ll use them
                    often, so it’s best to learn the rules. In this guide, we answer the question, “What is a
                    demonstrative pronoun?” and explain everything you need to know to use them correctly.

                <h4> What is a demonstrative pronoun?</h4>
                <p>
                    The demonstrative pronouns <b> this, that, these, and those </b> are used to represent an already
                    mentioned
                    or implied word or phrase, helping make communication faster and easier.
                    <br><br>
                    See the red jacket? I want <b>that.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    In the demonstrative (pronounced deh-mon-struh-tiv) pronoun example above, the word <b>that</b>
                    represents
                    the red jacket mentioned earlier. The speaker is really saying, “I want the red jacket.”
                    <br><br>
                    Like all pronouns, demonstrative pronouns can refer to anything. However, the speaker must make it
                    clear what they are talking about; when they don’t, demonstrative pronouns become confusing. The
                    thing a pronoun represents is called the antecedent; in the demonstrative pronoun example above, the
                    antecedent is the red jacket.

                <h4>How to use demonstrative pronouns
                    <br><br>
                </h4>
                <p>
                    When writing, you have to use the right type of demonstrative pronoun. The four demonstrative
                    pronouns are divided into two categories: <b>singular/plural </b> <b> and near/far b</b> .
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Singular/plural </b>refers to the number of the antecedent. If the antecedent is one thing, use
                    the
                    singular demonstrative pronouns this or that. If the antecedent is multiple things, use the plural
                    demonstrative pronouns these or those.
                    <br><br>
                    Don’t touch the chocolate cupcake. <b> That </b> is mine.
                    <br><br>
                    Don’t touch the chocolate cookies. <b> Those </b> are mine.
                    <br><br>
                    <b> Near/far </b> can mean distance or time. The near demonstrative pronouns <b> this and these </b>
                    can refer to
                    something close to the speaker or something that happened or was mentioned recently. That and those
                    represent something physically farther away or that happened longer ago.
                    <br><br>
                    The movie last night was awful. <b> This </b> is the last time you recommend one.
                    <br><br>
                    The movie two weeks ago was worse. <b> That </b> was a nightmare!
                    <br><br>
                    Be careful, because demonstrative pronouns aren’t always used literally. They can also be used
                    figuratively to describe an idea or concept instead of an actual thing with distance.
                    <br><br>
                    Your relationship stresses you out. Do you want <b> that </b> in your life?
