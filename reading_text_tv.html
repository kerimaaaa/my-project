                    In 1991, the American band The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy (that's "hip-hop-risy") called
                    television "the drug of the nation." But more than 30 years later, more and more people are turning
                    away from their televisions.

                    So, has the world kicked the TV habit?

                    Well, many of us might not be watching regular TV, but instead we're getting our entertainment from
                    streaming services and mobile devices.

                    In February 2023, Insider Intelligence predicted that in the US in 2023, for the first time ever,
                    people will spend more time watching digital video than traditional TV.

                    So how did we get here?

                    It was the Scotsman John Logie Baird who built the first prototype television in 1925. At first not
                    many people were impressed — the quality of early TVs was poor, and the entertainment wasn't much
                    better. But progress was quietly being made.

                    Just after World War II, around 8,000 homes in the US had a TV. By 1960, this number had risen to
                    more than 45 million — and the television had overtaken the radio as the device to gather around.
                    <br> <br>
                    TV watching became part of the family routine. And when choice was limited in its early days,
                    millions of people watched the same shows together — something we might now call "event television."

                    Cable and digital TV, with hundreds of channels, began to change that, and event television has now
                    become increasingly rare.

                    While the popularity of streaming and short online videos is recent, perhaps the move away from
                    communal TV began when television sets became cheaper and families could afford to buy an extra one
                    for the bedroom or the kitchen. There was no more fighting about what to watch — but also less
                    watching together.

                    Now, with younger generations used to immediate access to content, television as we knew it shows
                    little sign of making a return.

                    Will it die?

                    It will certainly change. Experts say TV has a future with sports and news. But scripted shows like
                    comedies and dramas will be seen more on streaming services, and less on TV.
