                    "Oh, what a surprise!"
                    <br>
                    What do you think this sentence means? Probably one of two things — either that someone is actually
                    surprised, or they're being sarcastic.

                    This might be one of the most common examples of sarcasm — using words that mean the opposite of
                    what you really intend to say.

                    "My daughter has left her socks on the floor again — what a surprise!"

                    "The train is late again — what a surprise!"

                    Sarcasm can be a useful tool: it might help you control your emotions when you'd like to throw those
                    socks out the window, or it could offer some humor as you wait for that train.

                    And in some situations, sarcasm can be easier than literal honesty.

                    However, being on the receiving end of this type of sarcasm can be annoying. This is something
                    parents of teenagers may know all about.
                    <br> <br>

                    But in an article for the BBC, science writer David Robson suggests that frustration might not be
                    the best response to such sarcasm. That's because sarcasm is a linguistic skill that we learn — it's
                    "evidence of maturity," Robson says.

                    "Sarcasm is complex," he explains: it requires the child to understand both the literal meaning of
                    their words and what they actually want the other person to understand. This two-step mental process
                    is more challenging than making a literal statement.

                    Studies have found that children only begin to understand basic sarcasm around age 5 or 6 — and it
                    isn't until age 8 or 9 that they understand sarcasm as humor.

                    Penny Pexman of the University of Calgary thinks sarcasm is something we can — and should — teach.
                    She even wrote a short story designed to help children between ages 4 and 7 learn to detect it.

                    So when your teenager rolls their eyes and tells you, "Oh, I do so love hearing your opinions about
                    my music" — when they really mean the opposite — it's evidence that their brain has developed and
                    that they're maturing!
